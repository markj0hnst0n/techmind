[Imprima](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Imprima) was the font that was used for the whole website. 

## Colour Scheme

### Features

- All pages fully reponsive on all screen sizes.
- Fully functioning navigation links on all pages for ease of access through site.
- Optional audio played through game.
- Randomised questions specifically about women in tech.
- Continuous score updates as the game progresses.
- Continuous question number updates as the game progresses.
- Ability to enter name at the end of the game to add to a local leader board.
- Local leader board accessible after site is closed and reopened.

### Features not implemented

- At the moment the user scores are only stored in local storage so there is no 'global' leaderboard which would be a nice addition.
